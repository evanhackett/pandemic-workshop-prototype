## Next steps

## Next steps
* Makes walls count
* Rethink what the assignment is. What should the student do?
* Special event listening system that is observered by other things. eg graphs or counters 
* Make it so medics do not share the same target, somehow.
* The medics and the OBSERVER PATTERN???
* look into request animiation frame?
* WebGL?

## The future
